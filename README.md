Hi there! So what is this about... 
In low-dimensional topology or knot theory one might need to compute polynomial or invariants of a given knot. This is not an easy computational tasks and, of course, there already exist computational softwares that do this. For example: Regina 

The problem: Often coding the knot one is interested in into Regina is time consuming

The solution: This code tries to turn a photo of a Knot into Regina code, so it later process it.
